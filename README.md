## 💫 About Me

👋🏽 Hi there! I'm **Karthik Rudrappa**, a London-based **Data Analyst** specialising in customer insights, predictive analytics, and workflow automation. I have strong hands-on experience in **SQL, Python, Power BI, and data engineering workflows**, with a passion for turning raw data into clear, actionable insights that drive business decisions.

📊 Currently, I work as a **Data Analyst at Gigaclear**, where I analyse customer behaviour, build scalable BI dashboards, and develop automated reporting solutions and **Salesforce Automations using Python Scripts**. My work includes churn analysis, forecasting, experiment analytics, and integrating APIs like Salesforce & Trustpilot to create real-time visibility into customer sentiment.

💼 Previously, I worked as a **Business Analyst at VMware**, supporting community engagement analytics and Agile delivery across the APJ & EMEA regions. I collaborated closely with Product Managers and used data-driven insights to support platform enhancements and strategic growth initiatives.

🚀 I also bring early-stage exposure from **Apna (a Sequoia-funded startup)**, where I helped implement enterprise CRM systems, documented business requirements, and streamlined operational processes. Working in a fast and high-growth environment strengthened my ability to solve problems quickly, work cross-functionally, and design processes that scale.

🛠️ With expertise in **Python, SQL, Power BI, Automation, APIs, and predictive modelling**, I enjoy working at the intersection of data and business—building solutions that improve efficiency, support decision-making, and enhance customer experience. I'm always exploring new ways to leverage analytics, automation, and machine learning to solve real-world challenges.
